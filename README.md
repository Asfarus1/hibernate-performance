This is a set of samples for basic features of Hibernate covered in "Hibernate performance tuning".

Slides and video may be found here: http://jeeconf.com/program/hibernate-performance-tuning/.

You are free to use and distribute them as is if you promise to run tests and understand how things work under the hood. ;)
